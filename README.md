## Hi! Welcome to my Github, I'm Locus ðŸ‘‹

My name is Locus, and Iâ€™m currently a high school student based in Eastern, Saudi Arabia. I have a keen interest in both physics and Computer Science, Physics fascinates me, and I find it incredibly interesting to explore the fundamental principles that govern our universe.

In addition to my academic interests, I enjoy discussing technology-related topics, such as internet speed and advancements in tech. Iâ€™m also curious about game development and modding, particularly in Tech like Operating Systems.

Iâ€™m excited to continue learning and exploring these fields, and Iâ€™m always open to new opportunities and experiences that can help me grow both academically and personally.
